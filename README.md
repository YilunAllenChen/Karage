# Karage
Karage is a home-made all-in-one platform for garage trading, implemented in Rust.

# A Few Words
- This project is mostly done for fun and self-improvement purposes. I'm not a professional Rust programmer
but I do enjoy coding in it. If any of the code disgusts you, hit me up with a DM, or submit a PR.
- This project is, as of today, not built to share. Therefore documentations about setting up could be lacking.
Let me know if it's bothering you.
- That said, use this repo at your own risk, and have fun.

# Goals
Have a modular, performant, reliable, highly compatible set of infrastructure that supports different styles of trading.
- Modular: A lot of the modules should be plug-and-play.
- Performant: Fast and scalable.
- Reliable: Minimal down time and wrong execution.
- Compatible: Easily extendable to new exchanges
- Styles of Trading: Click, Hybrid, Systematic, Autonomous, etc.
